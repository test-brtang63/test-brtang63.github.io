summary: We cover selected topics Reinforcement Learning. 
abstract: Our seminar mainly focuses on the book "Reinforcement Learning :An Introduction". We the basic parts of Reinforcement Learning, including Multi Armed Bandit, Thompson Sampling, Markov Decision Process, Monte Carlo Methods, Temporal-Difference Learning, On-policy Approximations and Policy Gradient Methods.
